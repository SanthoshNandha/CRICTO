### Supporting Sensemaking through Crowdsourced Information Schematization

## About

CRICTO ia a new crowdsourcing visual analytics environment for making sense of and analyzing text data. Multiple crowdworkers are able to parallelize the simple information schematization tasks of relating and connecting entities across multiple text documents. The diverse links from these schematization tasks are then automatically combined and the system visualizes them based on the semantic types of the linkages. CRICTO also includes several tools that allow analysts to interactively explore and refine crowdworkersâ€™ results to better support their own sensemaking processes.
